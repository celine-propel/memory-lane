PATIENT,The letter 's' followed by a randomly-assigned six-digit number.MANUALLY_REVIEWED_1yes_0no,"Did the authors manually review the patient's electronic medical record? Values are either 1 (yes) or 0 (no). If a patient's value for this column is 0, then expect several subsequent columns -- those based on manual review -- to have a value of NA (unknown / data not available)."AGE,"ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: This is the patient's age on the first clinical encounter (between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL) with author D.B. THIS WAS REVISED TO BINNED AGE FOR DRYAD: ""18_24"" indicates age between 18 and 24 years, inclusive. ""25_29"" indicates age between 25 and 29 years, and so on. For patient records undergoing manual review, we also stored the age at the time of the index event (which need not have happened on the first clinical encounter with D.B.). However, once ages were binned, we found no differences between that manually-derived value and the value obtained from automated data extraction. "AUTO_LEGAL_SEX,"Based on automated data extraction from the electronic medical record, what was the patient's ""legal sex"". All values were either M (man/male) or W (woman/female). Upon manual chart review, there were three cases where the self-identified sex somehow mismatched the automated data extraction (in two of the three, ""Other"" was listed instead of man/male or woman/female). Adhering to Dryad's policy on limiting the number of indirect identifiers of patients (""Sexual attitudes, practices, or orientation"" is an indirect identifier), those three records are not highlighted in this repository."RACE_ETHNICITY,"Values for race and ethnicity are here concatenated (with a separating underscore) into a single entry. Where available, we base this on manual chart review. Race options were either AA (African American or Black), AI (American Indian or Alaska Native), AS (Asian), NH (Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander), W (White), O (Other), or NA (unknown / data not available).  Ethnicity options are either 1 (""Hispanic or Latino""), 0 (""Not Hispanic or Latino""), or NA (unknown / data not available). Thus, a patient self-identifying as ""non-Hispanic White"" would have a entry of W_0. A different patient identifying as ""Hispanic Other"" would have an entry of O_1. If neither race nor ethnicity are known, the entry is NA_NA."YR_EDU,"ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: Where available, we base this on manual chart review. A number describing patient's level of educational achievement. If a neuropsychologist’s report is available, this number is used. If not, but level of education was reported in a neurologist's (typically author D.B.'s) report, that number is used. Non-integers are thereby allowed (e.g., ""I took one semester of college"" could be coded by a clinician as 12.5 years). If not, other numerical report of level of education is used. If, instead, a statement of level of education is available, it is converted to numbers in the following way: If a patient did not graduate high school, then the last grade completed is the number (e.g., ""completed 8th grade"" is represented by an 8). If the patient had a GED or high school diploma the value is 12. If the patient was said to have “some college but no degree”, the value is 13. A single highest degree is coded as follows; Associate's (14), Bachelor's (16), Master's (18), PhD or professional degree (20). An extra year was added to the value if there were two equal ""highest degrees"" (e.g., if a patient earned two Associate's degrees, the value would be 15; for two Master’s degrees, the value would be 19). Military experience is not counted in this number. If there was insufficient information to judge years of education (e.g., ""retired nurse"" could cover a wide range of education levels), then the value is NA (unknown/ data not available). THIS WAS REVISED TO BINNED YEARS OF EDUCATION FOR DRYAD: Based on the numbers detailed in the original description, this was binned in the following way: ""under_12"" means < 12 yr of education (less than high school graduate or GED). ""12_13"" means someone who obtained 12-13.9 years of education (generally represents someone who is a high school graduate or obtained a GED, and may or may not have attended some college, but obtained no post-secondary degree). ""14_15"" means someone who obtained 14-15.9 years of education (generally represents someone who obtained an Associate’s degree, but not a Bachelor’s degree). ""16_17"" means someone who obtained 16-17.9 years of education (generally represents someone who obtained a Bachelor’s degree, but not a Master’s degree or higher). ""18_19"" indicates someone who obtained 18-19.9 years of education (generally represents someone who obtained a Master’s degree, but no PhD nor professional degree). ""20_or_more"" means someone who obtained ≥ 20 years of education (generally represents a PhD or professional degree)."AUTO_ALZHEIMERS_INITIAL_VISIT_1yes_0no,"Based on automated data extraction from the electronic medical record, for the first clinical encounter (between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL) with author D.B., does an ICD10 code attached to that encounter affirmatively label the patient as having Alzheimer's? This was captured by G30.0, G30.1, and G30.9.  Values are either 1 (yes) or 0 (no). The initial automated search flagged any ICD10 associated with the word ""Alzheimer"", also capturing Z82.0 -- family history of Alzheimer's disease -- which was ignored when assigning a value for this column. Because ICD10 code assignment is not exhaustive, a value of 0 does not mean the absence of Alzheimer's, and a value of 1 does not imply the absence of other etiologies. "AUTO_DEMENTIA_INITIAL_VISIT_1yes_0no,"Based on automated data extraction from the electronic medical record, for the first clinical encounter (between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL) with author D.B., does an ICD10 code attached to that encounter affirmatively label the patient as having ""dementia""? This was captured by F01.5, F02.8, or F03.9. Two instances of Z81.8 (family history of dementia) from the automated search were ignored.  Values are either 1 (yes) or 0 (no). Because ICD10 code assignment is not exhaustive, a value of 0 does not mean the absence of dementia. "INDEX_EVENT,"Values are either MMSE (Mini Mental State Exam), MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), SATURN (Self-Administered Tasks Uncovering Risk of Neurodegeneration), or SLUMS (St. Louis University Mental Status exam), depending the test(s) used on encounter(s) between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL with author D.B. If SATURN was used, then the first time that SATURN was used is the index event (warranting a value of ""SATURN""). If SATURN was not used, then the first time author D.B. administered either the MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS (whichever came first) is the index event. If author D.B. never tested the patient with SATURN, MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL, then the value is ""NA"" (unknown / data not available) and subsequent columns offer additional information. If the chart was not manually reviewed at all (see MANUALLY_REVIEWED_1yes_0no column) then the value for this columns is NA (unknown / data not available), as are the values for subsequent columns. In rare cases where two tests are performed on day of the index event, then (a) if SATURN was one of those tests, the value for this column is ""SATURN"", and (b) if SATURN was not used, whichever test shows up first in the physician's note is listed (as for s441322)."NO_INDEX__NO_COGNITIVE_COMPLAINT,"If the chart was not manually reviewed, the value is ""NA"". If the author D.B. tested the patient with SATURN, MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL, then the value is ""NA"". For all other cases, the value is either 1 (neither the patient, nor any accompanying informants (if present), has cognitive complaints nor concerns), or 0 (there are cognitive complaints or concerns). A value of ""1"" implies a misdirected referral. "NO_INDEX__MODERATE_OR_SEVERE_DEMENTIA,"If the chart was not manually reviewed, the value is ""NA"". If the author D.B. tested the patient with SATURN, MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL, then the value is ""NA"". For all other cases, the value is either 1 (yes, testing the patient with either the SATURN, MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS  was not performed because it would have negligible value in the setting the patient's profound impairment due to moderate- or severe-stage dementia), or 0 (no, there was some other reason testing with SATURN, MoCA, etc., was not done). "NO_INDEX__BUT_SAGE_OR_SHORTBLESSEDTEST,"If the chart was not manually reviewed, the value is ""NA"". If the author D.B. tested the patient with SATURN, MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL, then the value is ""NA"". For all other cases, the value is either 1 (yes, the author D.B. tested the patient with the Self-Administered Gerocognitive Exam (SAGE) or the Short Blessed Test between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL), or 0 (no, neither the SAGE nor the Short Blessed Test were used). "NO_INDEX__PROMINENT_APHASIA,"If the chart was not manually reviewed, the value is ""NA"". If the author D.B. tested the patient with SATURN, MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL, then the value is ""NA"". For all other cases, the value is either 1 (yes, the patient had such prominent aphasia that testing with MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS was not performed because the aphasia would so deeply undermine performance), or 0 (no, there was no prominent aphasia that would interfere with testing). "NO_INDEX__SENSORY_LOSS,"If the chart was not manually reviewed, the value is ""NA"". If the author D.B. tested the patient with SATURN, MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL, then the value is ""NA"". For all other cases, the value is either 1 (yes, the patient had such sensory loss (hearing/vision/both) that testing with MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS was not performed because the sensory loss would so deeply undermine performance), or 0 (no, there was no prominent sensory loss that would interfere with testing). "NO_INDEX__OTHER_TESTING,"If the chart was not manually reviewed, the value is ""NA"". If the author D.B. tested the patient with SATURN, MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL, then the value is ""NA"". For all other cases, the value is either 1 (yes, testing with MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS was skipped because recent testing of adequate depth and quality was already performed by another provider, or soon would be), or 0 (no, recent or planned testing by another provider was not a factor in deciding to skip testing with MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS). "NO_INDEX__LOW_ENTHUSIASM,"If the chart was not manually reviewed, the value is ""NA"". If the author D.B. tested the patient with SATURN, MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL, then the value is ""NA"". For all other cases, the value is either 1 (yes, testing with MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS was skipped because patient enthusiasm was too low), or 0 (no, patient enthusiasm not a factor in deciding to skip testing with MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS). "NO_INDEX__BUT_SUBSET_DONE,"If the chart was not manually reviewed, the value is ""NA"". If the author D.B. tested the patient with SATURN, MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS between 2020-AUG and 2022-JUL, then the value is ""NA"". For all other cases, the value is either 1 (yes, testing with some named, interpretable, abbreviated, published form of the MoCA, MMSE, or SLUMS was performed), or 0 (no, there was no testing with a named, interpretable, abbreviated, published form of those tests). Examples of a ""named, interpretable, abbreviated, published form"" of those tests include the Mini-Cog (clock drawing + three word recall), the six-item screener (orientation to month, year, day of the week, and three word recall), and the MoCA-BLIND. "PRIMARY_LANGUAGE,"A patient's primary language, based on manual chart review. Like all subsequent columns, the value here is ""NA"" if the chart was not manually reviewed. If the value for the ""EXCLUDED_NOT_NATIVE_ENGLISH__1yes_0no"" column is 1, then this must list something other than ENGLISH."EXCLUDED_NO_TWO ASSESSMENTS__1yes_0no,"To be included in most of the analyses, a patient must have two scores from the following tests (two scores from the same test is permissible) within the two-year period spanning +/- 365 days of the index event: SATURN, MoCA, MMSE, SLUMS. Values are either 1 (yes, the patient is excluded because there are less than two scores on record), or 0 (no, the patient is not excluded). A value of NA occurs only if there was no manual chart review."EXCLUDED_NOT_NATIVE_ENGLISH__1yes_0no,"To be included in most of the analyses, a patient must be a ""native"" English speaker. This was operationalized by asking whether -- through age 14 -- there was likely at least one year where the patient primarily used English either in the home or outside the home (or both). If this was not the case, then the value is 1 (yes the patient is excluded because he or she is not a native English speaker). If this was the case -- if there was at least one year of English exposure through age 14 -- the value is 0 (no, the patient is not excluded because he or she is a native English speaker). A value of NA occurs only if there was no manual chart review."EXCLUDED_PRIMARILY_NOT_NEURODEGENERATIVE__1yes_0no,"If the patient has enough cognitive impairment that a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (mild neurocognitive disorder) or dementia (major neurocognitive disorder) _but_ the cause of the impairment is predominantly a non-neurodegenerative process, then the patient is excluded from most analyses. Examples include (a) a patient with impaired test scores that later normalized when polypharmacy was addressed, (b) a patient with a history of traumatic brain injury, and the traumatic brain injury reasonably accounts for impaired test scores, even if there is subjective worsening over time, (c) a patient with an un- or under-treated psychiatric disorder that adequately explains the impaired test scores. For those patients, the value here is 1 (yes, the patient is excluded due to a prominent non-neurodegenerative disorder causing cognitive impairment). For all other manually-reviewed patients, the value is 0 (no, the patient is not excluded). Regardless of the presence or absence of complicating diagnoses (e.g., under-treated depression), and regardless of the presence or absence of cognitive complaints, if a patient does _not_ have impairment on testing (as judged by author D.B.) then the value in this column is 0 (not excluded). A value of NA occurs only if there was no manual chart review."EXCLUDED_SATURN_FOR_RESEARCH__1yes_0no,"To avoid re-using participant data from future studies in the present study, we exclude patients who were assessed with SATURN as part of some other study protocol. Values are either 1 (yes, the patient is excluded because SATURN was administered as part of another study), or 0 (no, the patient is not excluded). A value of NA occurs only if there was no manual chart review."GENERAL_Dx,"What is the overarching diagnosis, at the time of the index visit; normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, or some other category? If the patient had dementia according to the index visit documentation of author D.B., the value is DEMENTIA. (Note: ""Dementia"" is generally used interchangeably with DSM-5 criteria for major neurocognitive disorder. Clinically relevant exceptions arose when counseling on driving limitations in a borderline case, which reference April 2010 Practice Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (Iverson DJ, Gronseth GS, Reger MA, Classen S, Dubinsky RM, Rizzo M; Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology. Practice parameter update: evaluation and management of driving risk in dementia: report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology. Neurology. 2010 Apr 20;74(16):1316-24. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181da3b0f. Epub 2010 Apr 12. PMID: 20385882; PMCID: PMC2860481), which predate the DSM-5 and therefore are using DSM IV criteria.) At the time of the index visit, if the patient had mild cognitive impairment according to the index visit documentation of author D.B., the value is MCI. (MCI is used interchangeably with DSM-5 criteria for mild neurocognitive disorder.) If the patient had no cognitive impairment according to the index visit documentation of author D.B., the value is NORMAL.  _Importantly_, if a patient was documented as being ""on the border"" between one label and another, the less-severe (more normal) label is coded here. For instance, a patient said to be ""on the borderline between mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia"" would be coded as MCI in this column. The value OTHER is used when the value in column ""EXCLUDED_PRIMARILY_NOT_NEURODEGENERATIVE__1yes_0no"" is 1. There was enough heterogeneity across those OTHER patients, and much complexity for each (e.g., a man who had schizoaffective disorder, later suffered multiple traumatic brain injuries, and then hypoxic brain injury due to a suicide attempt) that no further coding of etiology was attempted. Aside from a single patient who was erroneously referred for non-cognitive issues (s118710), a value of NA means that the record was not manually reviewed. All others were issued a general diagnosis. "SEVERITY_DEMENTIA,"If the patient had dementia according to the index visit documentation of author D.B., what was the stated severity of that dementia in the index visit documentation? Possible values are MILD (mild dementia, implying fully intact basic activities of daily living, such as dressing, bathing, toileting, continence, transferring, feeding), MODERATE (moderate dementia, implying some loss of a basic activity of daily living), or SEVERE (severe dementia, implying all or nearly all basic activities of daily living are lost). Importantly, a patient documented as being on the borderline between two severity levels is issued the less severe of the two: Someone with a ""mild-to-moderate"" dementia on the index visit would be coded as MILD. Rarely (two of the first three hundred forty two records we manually reviewed) severity was not specified, in which case author D.B. reviewed the note to adjudicate."ETIOLOGY_Dx,"The best etiologic diagnosis at the time of chart review. It is only this column and the next one which permit information obtained after 2022-JUL: Searching the chart for notes from author D.B. (a chart search strategy, given his distinct last name) often revealed an updated etiologic diagnosis  (up to 4 yr after the index visit). This was especially true with the advent of lecanemab, leading to an increase in Alzheimer's biomarker testing, which in turn led to some patients being known to the chart review team as part of regular clinical practice. Thus, a patient who had a NORMAL ""GENERAL_Dx"" on the intake visit could  have demonstrated progressive decline on follow-up visits, leading to a test of Alzheimer's biomarkers and an etiologic diagnosis. Similarly, a patient who had a NORMAL ""GENERAL_Dx"" could later develop parkinsonism, offering a likely etiologic diagnosis for his or her initial cognitive complaints. Sometimes a patient with a NORMAL ""GENERAL_Dx"" can have an etiology identified around the time of the index visit. For instance, two were identified as having an alpha-synucleinopathy by respectively meeting criteria for pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. All others with an alpha-synucleinopathy had cognitive impairment as part of a presentation of Parkinson's disease or Lewy body disease. Several values are possible in this field: NPH (Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus), RAD (whole brain radiation), FX (either Fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome, or Fragile X syndrome; supported by genetic testing), and CJD (Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease; autopsy confirmed in the one patient earning that label), are listed as the sole cause, even if another concurrent neurodegenerative disorder were possible. This is also true of OTHER (covering one case of Prader-Willi syndrome (s314518), one case of multiple sclerosis (s333478), one case of progressive myoclonic epilepsy (s089202), and one case with antibodies to the alpha 3 ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (s567162)). For all other etiologies, MIXED (without further qualification) would be used if multiple etiologies were suspected, but could not be put into one of three common mixed categories based on chart review: MIXED_ALZ_VASC (mixed Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease), MIXED_ALPHA_ALZ (mixed alpha-synucleinopathy and Alzheimer's disease; a physician diagnosis of the ""Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease"" would be coded this way), and MIXED_ALPHA_VASC (mixed alpha-synucleinopathy and cerebrovascular disease). The remaining possibilities are ALPHA (alpha-synucleinopathy, including Parkinson's disease dementia, Lewy body dementia, multiple system atrophy), ALZ (Alzheimer's disease, includes variants such as the ""frontal variant"" in the setting abnormal Alzheimer's biomarkers, or logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia), CAA (cerebral amyloid angiopathy), CBS (corticobasal syndrome / corticobasal degeneration), PSP (progressive supranuclear palsy), VASC (vascular cognitive impairment when ""CAA"" does not apply; encompassing both the sequelae of clinically significant microvascular disease and/or sequelae of prior ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke), and WK (Wernicke-Korsakoff or ""thiamine deficiency""). At the time of chart extraction, four phenomonological diagnoses were logged; BVFTD (behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia), NFVPPA (non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia), SVPPA (semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia) -- which were retained -- and posterior cortical atrophy clinico-radiological syndrome (PMC3590050), which was generally coded as Alzheimer's, unless there was chart assertion of a PCA-PLUS syndrome that would instead be better-coded as ALPHA or CBS. The value NA is common, and means no specific etiology was provided."ETIOLOGY_AlzheimersBiomarker,"At the time of chart review, note if the patient is PETpositive (an amyloid PET scan was consistent with Alzheimer's disease), CSFpositive (cerebrospinal fluid testing consistent with Alzheimer's disease), PETnegative (an amyloid PET scan _not_ consistent with Alzheimer's disease), or CSFnegative  (cerebrospinal fluid testing _not_ consistent with Alzheimer's disease). Borderline results (most common, in our experience, with the Athena CSF assay) were placed into one of those categories if they increased the clinician's confidence in the Alzheimer's diagnosis. An NA indicates there is no known testing for Alzheimer's biomarkers."NEUROPSYCH_TIME_SINCE_INDEX_days,"The number of days that have passed between the index event and formal neuropsychological testing. Negative numbers indicate days before the index event, positive numbers indicate days after the index event. If no formal neuropsychological testing was performed (or, for a few cases, if censored; see ""NEUROPSYCH_Dx"") the value here is NA."NEUROPSYCH_Dx,"The general diagnosis provided by the neuropsychologist. With only a few exceptions, neuropsychological testing lead to a diagnosis of either major neurocognitive disorder (DEMENTIA), mild neurocognitive disorder (MCI), or some variation of cognitively normal (NORMAL). The exceptions are censored (NA) but described here: s587812 and s104205 had substantial non-neurodegenerative causes for cognitive impairment (e.g., severe language deficits due to left temporal lobe resection). Due to somnolence, s672498 had such minimal testing that no conclusions could be made. s641190 had testing while hospitalized. s126800 had poor performance on embedded validity tests."FAQ_TIME_SINCE_INDEX_days,"The number of days that have passed between the index event and clinic use of Pfeffer et al's Functional Activities Questionnaire (Journal of Gerontology, 37(3), 323-329). Negative numbers indicate days before the index event, positive numbers indicate days after the index event. If this questionnaire was not used (or if <90% of it was filled out, meaning more than one of the ten items was skipped) the value here is NA. "FAQ_TOTAL_SCORE,"The total score on the FAQ (range 0-30). Some informants would place a mark on the border between two ratings, and this was transcribed to the best of the clinician's ability (e.g., marking on the line between a 0 and a 1 would be recorded as a 0.5)."FAQ_POSSIBLE_SCORE,"The FAQ was handed to a person accompanying the patient to the clinic. That informant was thereby asked to rate the patient's abilities on ten items (e.g., preparing a balanced meal) according to whether the patient performs it normally (0 points), has difficulty (1 point), requires assistance (2 points) or is dependent (3 points). The maximum score is the sum of those ten ratings, 30, if all items are answered. If some items were skipped, then the revised maximum is listed here. Based on our data extraction and analysis plan, if more than one item was skipped (which would yield a total possible score less than 27) the data are censored (NA). "FAQ_BONUS_QUESTION_SCORE,"The score on ""bonus question"" added by author D.B. to the FAQ, asking the informant to rate the patient's abilities with ""using a smartphone, computer"" on the same 0-3 point scale, where 0 is normal, and 3 is dependent."SATURN_LANGUAGE,"SATURN is available in multiple languages, although only the English-language version has been validated to-date (DOI: 10.1002/trc2.12116). Which version was given to the patient? The most common value for this column is ENGLISH. NA (unknown / data not available) implies SATURN was not administered. Note that SATURN does not have a ""_days_SINCE_INDEX"" column like the other tests do. When SATURN is used for a participant, it is the ""INDEX_EVENT"" as defined in this study, and ""_days_SINCE_INDEX"" will always be zero. Because author D.B. was the only provider regularly using SATURN for these patients (no instances of use by other providers were documented among patients D.B. saw), there is no ""_ADMINISTERED_BY_DB_1yes_0no"" column."SATURN_SCORABLE_1yes_0no,"If a patient is not able to advance through the first few items of SATURN (see DOI: 10.1002/trc2.12116 for details), the results are not scorable. "SATURN_TOTAL_SCORE,The total score earned by the patient on the SATURN screening test.SATURN_POSSIBLE_SCORE,"The total possible score if all answers were correct on SATURN.

No points are awarded for an incorrect answer. An ""NA"" is present if the patient never got to that task within the 15 min time limit. "SATURN_SCORE_MATH_SUBTRACT,"For those that encountered the task, two points are awarded if the correct answer ($100-$67 = $33) was entered when the patient hit ""next"" (no points deducted for trying to advance and hit ""next"" before entering in a two-digit answer). No points are awarded for an incorrect answer. Note that an incorrect response to the first item is likely to lead to an incorrect response on this item: No points are awarded for correctly subtracting the wrong answer from ""MATH_ADD"" from $100. For instance, if the answer to ""MATH_ADD"" was $45, and the answer to ""MATH_SUBTRACT"" was $55, no points would be awarded for either task. An ""NA"" is present if the patient never got to that task within the 15 min time limit. "SATURN_SCORE_STROOP_POINTS,"Three non-color words occur at the beginning, reinforcing instructions, but are not scored. Then, the patient responds to twelve Stroop items, which are scored in aggregate. One is not penalized if they absentmindedly try to advance without making a selection (in part, this is meant to avoid penalizing people who ""double tap"" the ""next"" button, although there should be enough other protections from this built into SATURN). One is penalized only if the incorrect color is selected when one hits ""next"". If a patient encounters the instructions for the Stroop within the 15 minute limit, the patient is invited to complete all Stroop items. Each patient that encounters the task starts with three points, and loses a point for every error made over twelve color-word trials. Values for this column are integers between 0 and 3 (inclusive), or NA."SATURN_SCORE_MINI_TRAILS_A,"For those that encountered the task, one point is awarded only if all numbers are selected in order before hitting ""next"". Hitting ""next"" too early (e.g., 1, 2, next) would mean no points are awarded. Similarly, hitting the items out of order (e.g., 1, 2, 4) would mean no points are awarded. There is no penalty for tapping outside of any of the buttons. "SATURN_SCORE_MINI_TRAILS_B,"For those that encountered the task, one point is awarded only if all numbers are selected in order before hitting ""next"". Hitting ""next"" too early (e.g., 1, A, 2, next) would mean no points are awarded. Similarly, hitting the items out of order (e.g., 1, A, 2, 3) would mean no points are awarded. There is no penalty for tapping outside of any of the buttons. "SATURN_READING_SPEED_median_words_per_s,"Each instruction screen (i.e., where the only task is to read what's written, and then hit ""next"") has a fixed number of words, and we track how long one spends on each screen. With that information, we calculate words per second for each instruction screen. Accepting that a patient may pause or be distracted on one or two screens (prolonging time spent on those instructions), the distribution of words per second calculated for each instruction screen could become skewed. For this reason, the median value of these word/second rates is selected from each patient. A higher value indicates faster reading. "SATURN_MOTOR_SPEED_ms_per_button,"For each task that uses a number pad, we track the time (in ms) between one button press and the next. So, when entering the number ""1239"", the time between 1 and 2 would be logged, as would the time between 2 and 3, as would the time between 3 and 9, as would the time between 9 and ""next"". Those four time intervals are stored. Later, the patient is asked what that four digit number was. Whatever they recall, times will be logged in the same way: Suppose they mis-remember it as 1289, the time between 1 and 2 would be logged, as would the time between 2 and 8, as would the time between 8 and 9, as would the time between 9 and ""next"". Now eight time intervals total are stored. Then, one is asked the year. If the patient enters 2019, then the time between 2 and 0 would be logged, as would the time between 0 and 1, as would the time between 1 and 9, as would the time between 9 and ""next"". Now, we have twelve total time intervals stored. If the participant quit at this time, we would take the median of those twelve values, and put it in this column. These tasks were preferred because we suspected most of the deliberation/calculation/planning would happen before a patient decides upon an answer -- either the two-digit number for SLUMS math items, or the four-digit number when asking year or for ""1239"". Use of the median is further protective; if the patient entered 1289, then deliberated on it before hitting ""next"", this would not significantly skew the median. In the initial 2020 validation study, we considered including other tasks in this motor speed estimate, but some items (like asking what month it is) require only two button-presses (the month and then ""next"") and so would only log one time interval. If someone tends to deliberate before hitting ""next"" (to double-check their response) then the central tendency would be skewed by deliberation, rather than capturing movement speed. Put differently, the tasks with the number pad are used for this measurement because the answer (e.g., 1239) is conceptually ""chunked"" into a single response, even though the interface requires a few small movements to enter that response. "SATURN_TOTAL_TIME_min,"As noted in the description for ""SATURN_SCORE_STROOP_POINTS"", for all tasks in SATURN, if one encounters a task's instructions within 15 min of starting, one is allowed to complete that task and earn points, even if completion pushes one beyond the 15 minute limit. For instance, if 14 minutes and 59 seconds into SATURN, a patient happens upon the input screen for five word recall, he or she is allowed to complete the task. Should that participant spend 7 minutes and 1 second entering those five words, the total time using SATURN would be 22 minutes. If instead the same patient was two seconds slower, SATURN would have ended at 15 minutes and 1 second, and would not have had a chance to earn any of those five points for word recall."SATURN_TIME_STROOP_ERRORS,The total number of errors one accumulates on the Stroop task (integer).SATURN_TIME_SIMPLE_ATTENTION_J_ms,"The total time (in ms) spent responding to this item.

Because author D.B. was the only provider regularly using this casual assessment of memory for these patients (no instances of use by other providers were documented among patients D.B. saw), there is no ""_ADMINISTERED_BY_DB_1yes_0no"" column. Near the end of the office visit, to perform this informal test of memory, the examiner would sequentially hide four uncommon objects in the room (with rare expectation, this was a Trömner reflex hammer, a tuning fork, a pen light, and a stethoscope). Each was displayed with motion and commented on (e.g., the examiner explains the hammer looks a bit like a hammer, but has a rubber piece at the head, it moves like a hammer [while swinging the hammer], and indeed was used like a hammer while testing reflexes) as it was slowly being hidden. It was also explained that the specific name of the object was not needed, and simply commenting ""the thing with the rubber piece"" or miming the hammering motion would be enough to uniquely identify the object. The examiner's monologue and use of uncommon objects was meant to engage the patient while making it harder for the patient to employ any verbal mnemonics. After several minutes that were typically spent discussing other test results, the examiner would ask ""What did I hide and where did I hide it?"". Identifying -- with words or pointing -- the hiding places would earn points (""Something is hidden in the bottom drawer.""), identifying the objects would earn points (""You hid a hammer.""), and extra points would be earned by linking that information -- ""You hid a hammer is in the bottom drawer""). The willingness to score a patient with aphasia (because pointing and miming are permissible) does depart slightly from the 3O3P, but it is otherwise so similar that we expect it will inherit the 3O3P's predictive value."HIDE4_LANGUAGE,"The most common value for this column is ENGLISH.
